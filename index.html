“Sorry been mad busy filming but just wanted to say how much I appreciate all the bday love last week,” he wrote with the pic, along with a heart and a rocket emoji.

In the photo, which was from his big day, on November 6th, sees Hero in the back of a car with a bunch of balloons. Check it out in the gallery!

Hero and his co-stars have been filming the next two movies in the After franchise, After We Fell and After Ever After in Europe.

In early October, there were quite a few casting changes for the upcoming films, which they are filming back to back.<br>Contact Us<br><br></div>
